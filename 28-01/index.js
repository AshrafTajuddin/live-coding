// Create a function that looks inside a givin string if it has the word (JavaScript) if so print "I know it's crazy ðŸ˜‰".

// Complete the function below so that it returns "Two for me and one for you" when no arguments are passed

// Complete the function below so that it still calculates the power of a number even if the `exp` argument is not passed to it. The default `exp` should be set to 2.
// Example: Calling the function with 2 and 4 will return 8 (2 to the power of 4), If you call it with just 2, it should return 4 (2 to the power of 2).

console.log(exponent(3)); // -> 9

// Create a function will calculate a student degrees for 6 subjects,
//if the average was less than 70 will print (F)
// Over 70 and less than 80 (C)
